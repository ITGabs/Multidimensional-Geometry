#In the Black Screen press any of these keys

These set of keys change the position of the figure rotating the Hipercube over it center incrementing the angle in any set of 2 coordenates (X, Y) , (Y, Z) , (Z, X) , (Z, U) , (X, U) , (Y, U)

notice Z and U are angles perpendicular with the screen, so e and r move the hipercube but the shadow from 4D to 3D to the screen 2D is exactly the same.
